Demonstrating the use of ML for digit classification using the MNIST dataset

This repo follows the excellent introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks given by Michael Nielsen at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com. The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is employed in the textbook and here. 

The notebooks have been written by/for me to learn and understand the lower level details of how machine learning algorithms work, as hands-on coding is the best way to gain experience in these topics.

Code in these notebooks are generally taken from that website, and may have been modified for my own experimentation purposes (and for Python 3 compatibility). 

Happy DL-ing with NNs! :)
