# mnist_demo
Demonstrating the use of ML for digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

This repo follows the excellent introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks given by Michael Nielsen at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com

Code in these notebooks are generally taken from that website, and had been modified for Python 3 compatibility and added functionality/experimentation.

Happy DL-ing with NNs! :)
